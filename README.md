# I want to use this!

You're free to use this for your own personal portfolio; but please do write to me telling me you have!
 
 - change the static content wherever it is to suit your work.
 - **NOTE**: Hard-refresh your browser (ctrl-shift-r) when you update the js files #19
 - change the `timeline.json` and `projects.json` files with your work and projects. 
 - send me an email at rishextra at gmail dot com. I'd really love to see it being used!

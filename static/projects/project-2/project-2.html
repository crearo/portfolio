    <span class="lb">This is an Android application with a simple interface to set consecutive alarms from a start time to an end time with
        a given interval, to make sure you wake up tomorrow morning. It uses the stock android clock as the base clock.
        Really is for the snooze lovers! It really helps wake spiderman up!

    <span class="lb">I tried using the alarms that gave you a difficult maths puzzle, but they really didn't work for me. I found
        myself setting a series of 5 alarms every night to make sure I wake up. This app simply automates the process.
